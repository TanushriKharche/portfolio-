    <h2><font color="red">My hobby</font></h2>
    <p><i><b>Writing poems </b>is one of my favorite hobbies. It allows me to express my thoughts, emotions, and experiences in a creative and meaningful way. Whether I’m inspired by nature, a moment in time, or just my own feelings, poetry helps me capture fleeting emotions and transform them into something beautiful. I enjoy playing with words, experimenting with different styles, and exploring rhythm and rhyme. Writing poetry is not just a form of self-expression; it’s also a way for me to connect with others, as poetry often resonates on a deep, personal level. It's a calming and rewarding 
        activity that gives me a sense of accomplishment whenever I finish a piece.</i></p>
